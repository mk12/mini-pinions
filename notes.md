# Notes

## Learning Clojure

I already know a bit about Lisp having read _The Little Schemer_, but Clojure is different. I am reading [A Brief Beginner's Guide to Clojure][1] to get started with it. I am using [Leiningen][2] to manage the project, which seems to be pretty standard in the Clojure community. To access everything that Processing offers, I am using [Quil][3]. Its README is pretty strange and interesting.
