# Mini Pinions

Mini Pinions is a game that I am making as my first summative for the ICS4U course. It is written in Clojure and it uses [Quil][1] to interface with [Processing][2].

## Gameplay

Fledge is special bird. His pinions are so mini that he can't fly on his own. Instead, he has to take advantage of gravity and slide along the landscape in order to keep moving. Control Fledge by clicking the mouse to make him nosedive, and bring him to the end of the level as fast as possible!
